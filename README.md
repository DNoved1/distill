=======

A dependently typed intermediate language.

Installing
----------

Requires the following:
* [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
* [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)
* Optionally [haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/), to generate
  documentation.

To build, run `cabal update && cabal install`.

Testing
-------

Same requirements as installing, but the command is instead `cabal test`
